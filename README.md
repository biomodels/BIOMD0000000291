**Abstract:**   
We proposed a mathematical model and estimated the parameters of adsorption of
albumin-bilirubin complex to the surface of carbon pyropolymer. Design data
corresponded to the results of experimental studies. Our findings indicate
that modeling of this process should take into account fractal properties of
the surface of carbon pyropolymer.
